SPAW Editor .NET Edition
Version 2.0.8

Thanks to everyone who downloaded and tried SPAW Editor v.2! 
Your feedback was extremely helpful.

This release adds an option to start editor in read-only mode + a couple bug 
fixes.

Known limitations:

- Defaults shown in VS2005 designer are hard-coded and wont match modified 
  spaw2.config settings;
- Some configuration properties can only be set through config file or accessing
  Editor.Configuration object directly

---
This release includes language files ported from PHP edition where some of them
were ported from version 1.

This means that some of the messages will appear in English instead of the
language of a specific language file. In case you are fluent in any language
that wasn't updated for version 2, we would really appreciate if you could invest
a little of your time to bring these files up to date.

We will post all the updates in our blog at http://blog.solmetra.com
